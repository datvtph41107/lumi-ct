# Contract Management System - Complete Implementation

## Overview
A comprehensive contract management system with full workflow support, notification system, audit logging, and role-based access control. The system supports three contract creation modes: Basic Form, Editor, and File Upload.

## System Architecture

### Frontend (React + TypeScript + Zustand)
- **Framework**: React 19 with TypeScript
- **State Management**: Zustand for global state management
- **Styling**: SCSS modules with CSS variables for theming
- **UI Components**: Custom components with FontAwesome icons
- **Routing**: React Router v7 with protected routes

### Backend (NestJS + TypeORM)
- **Framework**: NestJS with TypeScript
- **Database**: MySQL with TypeORM
- **Authentication**: JWT-based with role-based access control
- **File Upload**: Multer for file handling
- **Scheduling**: Cron jobs for notifications and reminders

## Core Features

   - Select creation mode (Basic/Editor/Upload)

2. **Basic Information** (`basic_info`)
   - Contract name, type, category
   - Priority settings
   - Tags and notes
   - Date ranges

3. **Content Draft** (`content_draft`)
   - Rich text editor for contract content
   - Template field population
   - File upload and processing
   - Auto-save functionality

4. **Milestones & Tasks** (`milestones_tasks`)
